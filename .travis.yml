# added `matrix` and `addons` sections from `sodium/.travis.yml`, as travis log
# indicated that "Configuration failed because libsodium was not found."

# then "no deploy key found" so ran...
# remotes::install_github("ropenscilabs/travis")
# travis::use_travis_deploy()

# then callr subprocess failed: SSL certificate problem: certificate has expired
# so deleted keys and ran the following:
# travis::travis_enable()
# travis::use_travis_deploy()

# also OSX failed w/ "fatal error: 'stdlib.h' file not found";
# so changed `osx_image` per https://travis-ci.community/t/r-3-6-broke-build-with-gcc-5-3-cant-find-stdlib-h/3227/5

# SSL still failing on Linux.
#   decided at least to simplify: one linux build, one mac
#   also removed latex false and fortran false, whims inspired by sodium repo
# on mac now get...
#   Installing md5deep
#   /Users/travis/.casher/bin/casher: line 208: brew: command not found
# poked around Googling this error; other people saw similar errors...
#   https://github.com/robotology/idyntree/issues/380
#   https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/3448
# guessing, decided to add brew update and brew install md5deep before_install

# Stardate 20191003, still stranded on this dismal planet of Travis-CI.
# Unsure the natives will allow us to return to our ship.
# SSL still failing on Linux, and getting a seemingly related error on MacOS:
