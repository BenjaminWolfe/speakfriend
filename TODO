# TODO

* consider a prompt_keyring_lock function, to allow package devs to do this:
  `if (keyring_locked()) on.exit(prompt_keyring_lock())`
  (have it check that it's locked first, and if it is it just does nothing)
* create options for when the user is not using RStudio?
* check what happens when knitting R Markdown?
* continue developing tests (see below)
* get Travis CI working (fix Mac? drop Mac?)
* group functions in pkgdown, especially unexported / re-exported ones, if kept
* increase the size of the text in the hex logo, re-deploy with use_logo
* submit to CRAN

# tests to develop

* interactive, no keyring, add when prompted
* interactive, create key adding password via dialog box
* automated, cannot create key via dialog box
* test the prompt_keyring_lock function, if I create that
